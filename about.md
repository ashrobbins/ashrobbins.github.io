I'm a front end developer living in the (mostly) sunny south west of England, with over 10 years of experience building stuff for the web.

I'm currently working for [Pulselive](http://www.pulselive.com), where we build some really cool sites and apps for clients in the sporting world.

Away from work I love football, and although I don't get to play as much since the birth of my daughters in mid 2017, most of the time you'll probably find me watching it, reading about it, or getting score updates.

This site will always be a work in progress. I use it to test out new stuff, and get itchy for a new design more often than I should. It's built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and I use [Forestry](https://forestry.io) to manage the content.
