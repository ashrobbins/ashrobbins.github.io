Offence by proxy

We live in a world these days where everyone is offended by everything and it's bloody boring. You genuinely can't say a single word out of place online without someone somewhere thinking you have offended, misappropriated, been sexist, racist, homophobic.

In those cases it just needs a quick correction and then everyone can move on with their lives.
