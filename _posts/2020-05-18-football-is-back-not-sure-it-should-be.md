I've missed football. A lot. United were in great form when the season was suspended and it looked like we were almost nailed on for a top 4 finish with the way we were playing.

Football every weekend is a massive part of most fans' weekly routine and not having the regularity of it has been a big factor in making the days feel like they blend into one at times. Even though it's just the Bundesliga and not our domestic league it still brings back a sense of normality. We can see who's playing tonight, live games are back on telly, people can have a bet and the season can actually carry on towards a "natural" conclusion.

It's going to be great for people's mental state to have sport back in our lives. If nothing else it'll provide a much needed morale boost in a funny old world where nothing feels quite normal at the moment. As more and more leagues and more and more sports come back online it will make things feel a bit less shit than they have done in recent months.

It looks like the majority of Premier League games are going to be televised which is ace, but it'll be a strange old watch if German football's return is anything to go by.

Empty stadiums are a given. No questions asked on that one, anyone with a brain can see that's the right decision for the rest of this season and I'd say probably even the majority of next season too.

Seeing subs sat in the front row of the stands, 2 or 3 metres apart and wearing face masks was a strange one, especially when the actual match itself is just taking place as normal with full contact allowed. But if you think about it that also makes sense, they're simply trying to limit the risk of infection as much as possible, so if you're not playing why wouldn't you wear a mask and keep your distance.

The social distancing celebrations will take some time to get used to as well, but I'm sure players will get creative with it and we'll see some entertaining stuff soon.
