I've missed football. A lot. United were in great form when the season was suspended and it looked like we were almost nailed on for a top 4 finish with the way we were playing.

Football every weekend is a massive part of most fans' weekly routine and not having the regularity of it has been a big factor in making the days feel like they blend into one at times. Even though it's just the Bundesliga and not our domestic league it still brings back a sense of normality. We can see who's playing tonight, live games are back on telly, people can have a bet and the season can actually carry on towards a "natural" conclusion.

It's going to be great for people's mental state to have sport back in our lives. If nothing else it'll provide a much needed morale boost in a funny old world where nothing feels quite normal at the moment. As more and more leagues and more and more sports come back online it will make things feel a bit less shit than they have done in recent months.
