There are a lot of things that piss me off about the web industry and the internet in general, so I thought I'd start a series of posts where I can rant about them.

## Sketchnotes from conference talks
What the hell is the point in these? They are just scribblings that don't capture anything about a talk, and are essentially a collection of disconnected sentences that barely relate to the subject.

How is that useful to anyone? Itâ€™s a collection of random words! You're meant to take notes so you dont forget stuff and you can read it back later.

Sketchnotes are basically just a way for people to show everyone else how good they are at drawing. They just give people something else to post on Twitter, and have no use to anyone except the person who drew them.

## Cat pictures
Don't get me wrong I think cats are ace, I've got a couple of my own. But who decided that every demo site or placeholder image should be a picture of a kitten?

Have a bit of imagination, there's bloody cats everywhere!

## Coffee
As soon as someone decides to embark on a career in the web industry, they also feel they need to become a bloody coffee connoisseur. Ordering in weird and random kinds of coffee from all over the world. It all stinks as much as each other so it makes no difference.

>"Have you tried these new beans from the arse-end of Ecuador? They are so aromatic and offer a much fuller flavour. I'm off to grind some beans right now actually. Don't be silly, of course I will measure them out first! I could never go back to instant, oh god no."

Piss off and fetch me a brew. And no I don\'t care what tea bags you use.
