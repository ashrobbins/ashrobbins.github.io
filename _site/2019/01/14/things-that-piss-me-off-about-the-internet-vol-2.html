<h2 id="offence-by-proxy">Offence by proxy</h2>

<p>We live in a world these days where everyone is offended by everything and it’s bloody boring. You genuinely can’t say a single word out of place online without someone somewhere thinking you have offended, misappropriated, been sexist, racist, homophobic.</p>

<p>Can we all just get a grip? I will admit that in some cases people are deliberately intending to cause harm, upset or damage to a person or group of people, and that is not ok. But quite often people might just post something without realising the meaning behind what they are doing. In those cases it just needs a quick correction and then everyone can move on with their lives.</p>

<p>A recent example is this tweet from Andrés Iniesta.</p>
