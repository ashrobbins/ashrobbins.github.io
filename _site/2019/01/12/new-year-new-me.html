    <p>The first post on this site is from September 2011, and there are only a pathetic 11 in total to show for the following 8 years.</p>

<p>I know for a fact that Iâ€™ve written other posts that just arenâ€™t on here now, either because I wasnâ€™t keen on them afterwards or theyâ€™ve fallen by the wayside during countless moves from one platform to the other.</p>

<p>Several times over the years Iâ€™ve tried to tell myself that I will post more on this blog, and sometimes itâ€™s worked for a month or two, but for some reason I never stick to it. I think Iâ€™ve been anxious that what I put out wouldnâ€™t be good enough in some way.</p>

<p>But enough of that rubbish. The web industry moves and changes so quickly and thereâ€™s always so much to learn. So a good use of this blog is to post things I learn, and if doing that is able to help someone along the way then great, if not Iâ€™ve still got a resource of personal learnings I can always refer back to.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see how long it lasts this timeâ€¦</p>
